# SpaceX Launch Programs SSR App (Server Side Rendering)

I have used Next JS to build SSR , react with typescript to get less error prone code at runtime (catch error at build ) but considering time constrains I've not added typescating then I've tried to use latest JS features like Array destructuring, Object destructuring, arrow functions etc.
